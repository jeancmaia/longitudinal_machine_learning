    "1. Exogenous Variables. \n",
    "    It is possible to include exogenous variables on the modeling of conditional variance dynamics. We simply modify the standard GARCH volatility function by writing\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x$ is an exogenous variable. To expand for multiple exogenous is straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Threshold-GARCH.\n",
    "    The model adds a dummy variable to the equation, which updates the model in different ways for positive and negative returns. This asymmetric response is usefull for modeling the \"leverage effects\" in stock returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sigma^2 = \\omega + \\alpha \\epsilon_{t-1}^2 + \\gamma \\epsilon_{t-1}^2 D + \\sigma_{t-1}^2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Exponential-GARCH.\n",
    "    The model specifies the variance by log operations, grounding for volatility driven by both size and sign of shocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---------\n",
    "### Final considerations on GARCH Models.\n",
    "\n",
    "As long as robust estimates come from the Maximum Likelihood Estimator, it is a straightforward choice for the optimization of GARCH. Moreover, no closed-form expression exists for the GARCH MLE; therefore, we maximize it numerically.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal h-step-ahead forecast is proportional to the optimal 1-step-ahead forecast, which is calculated by mean of lags of one period. Due to the volatility dynamics, the interval for a h-step-ahead forecast is given by: $y_{t+h,t} + 1.96\\sigma_{t+h,t}$\n",
    "\n",
    "A way to evaluate adequacy of a fitted GARCH model is by the correlogram of standardize returns, calculated with the conditional standard deviation from the fitted GARCH model $\\sigma$"
